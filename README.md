This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Management App

This is a simple project management application that uses Firebase for the backend including managing users, authentication and more.

I would like to thank The Net Ninja for providing the information for this via a YouTube tutorial.
