This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Management App

This is a simple project management application that uses Firebase for the backend including managing users, authentication and more.

I would like to thank The Net Ninja for providing the information for this via a YouTube tutorial.

### What's Involved

This is a full stack application using React and Redux on the frontend with the backend services managed by firebase, for this I have setup a firebase db, firebase authentication and implemented cloud functions, which is just javascript that is kept on the cloud.

### Features

Users can sign up, log in and out as well as view and create new projects, the projects all list on author as well as a time stamp.

The app is styled with materialize and works well as a basic project management app.

## Future Work

In the future I plan to add more layers of complexity in terms of features to give a better overall experience for the user and make this app my own.
